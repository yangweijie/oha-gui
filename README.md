# OHA GUI Tool

A cross-platform GUI application for HTTP load testing using the [oha](https://github.com/hatoo/oha) command-line tool. Built with PHP and the kingbes/libui library.

## Features

- **User-friendly GUI** for configuring HTTP load tests
- **Save and load** test configurations with persistent storage
- **Real-time test execution** and results display
- **Cross-platform support** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Multiple HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- **Custom headers and request body** configuration
- **Advanced test result parsing** and formatted display
- **Comprehensive error handling** with user guidance
- **Resource cleanup** and proper application lifecycle management
- **Platform-specific installation** instructions and troubleshooting

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **PHP 8.0+** with the following extensions:
  - `json` extension (usually included)
  - `pcntl` extension (for signal handling on Unix-like systems, optional)
- **Composer** - PHP dependency manager
- **kingbes/libui** package (installed via Composer)

### Required for Testing Functionality
- **oha** binary - The HTTP load testing tool
  - Download from: https://github.com/hatoo/oha/releases
  - Must be placed in the `bin/` directory of this application
  - The application will detect the binary automatically

## Quick Start

1. **Download and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd oha-gui-tool
   composer install
   ```

2. **Install OHA Binary**
   - Download oha from https://github.com/hatoo/oha/releases
   - Create `bin/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Place the binary in `bin/` directory:
     - Windows: `bin/oha.exe`
     - macOS/Linux: `bin/oha` (with execute permissions)

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   run.bat
   
   # macOS/Linux
   ./run.sh
   
   # Or directly
   php main.php
   ```

## Installation

### Detailed Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd oha-gui-tool
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Download and install oha binary**
   - **Windows**: Download `oha.exe` from the releases page
   - **macOS**: Download the macOS binary or use `brew install oha`
   - **Linux**: Download the Linux binary for your architecture
   - **Place the binary in the `bin/` directory** of this application
   - **Ensure execute permissions** (Unix-like systems): `chmod +x bin/oha`

## Usage

### Running the Application

#### Windows
```cmd
run.bat
```
or
```cmd
php main.php
```

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
./run.sh
```
or
```bash
php main.php
```

### Using the GUI

1. **Configure Test Parameters**
   - Enter the target URL
   - Select HTTP method
   - Set concurrent connections, duration, and timeout
   - Add custom headers and request body if needed

2. **Save/Load Configurations**
   - Save frequently used configurations for reuse
   - Load previously saved configurations
   - Manage your configuration library

3. **Run Tests**
   - Click "Start Test" to begin load testing
   - Monitor real-time output
   - View formatted results when complete
   - Stop tests early if needed

## Configuration

The application stores configurations in platform-specific directories:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\OhaGui\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/OhaGui/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/ohagui/`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"kingbes/libui package is not available"**
   - Run `composer install` to install all dependencies
   - Ensure Composer is properly installed and accessible
   - Check that the vendor directory exists and contains the kingbes/libui package

2. **"oha binary not found in bin directory"**
   - Download oha from https://github.com/hatoo/oha/releases
   - Place the binary in the `bin/` directory (create if it doesn't exist)
   - On Windows: use `oha.exe`, on Unix-like systems: use `oha`
   - Ensure execute permissions: `chmod +x bin/oha` (Unix-like systems)

3. **"Composer autoloader not found"**
   - Run `composer install` in the project directory
   - Ensure Composer is installed and accessible

4. **Configuration save/load issues**
   - Check write permissions to the configuration directory
   - Ensure adequate disk space is available
   - Configuration directory locations:
     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\OhaGui\`
     - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/OhaGui/`
     - Linux: `~/.config/ohagui/`

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- Use `oha.exe` in the `bin/` directory
- Run using `run.bat` or `php main.php`
- Some antivirus software may flag the executable - add exceptions if needed
- Ensure PHP is installed and accessible from command line

#### macOS
- Use `oha` binary in the `bin/` directory
- Run using `./run.sh` or `php main.php`
- You may need to allow the application in System Preferences > Security & Privacy
- Make the binary executable: `chmod +x bin/oha`

#### Linux
- Use `oha` binary in the `bin/` directory
- Run using `./run.sh` or `php main.php`
- Make the binary executable: `chmod +x bin/oha`
- Ensure you have the necessary PHP packages installed
