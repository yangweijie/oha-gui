# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a cross-platform GUI application for HTTP load testing using the kingbes/libui PHP library. The application will provide a user-friendly interface to configure and execute oha command-line pressure tests, with the ability to save and load test configurations in JSON format. The tool must work seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a GUI interface to configure HTTP load testing parameters, so that I can easily set up pressure tests without memorizing command-line syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main window with input fields for all oha parameters
2. WHEN I enter a URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and show validation feedback
3. WHEN I set concurrent connections THEN the system SHALL accept numeric values and validate reasonable ranges
4. WHEN I configure duration THEN the system SHALL accept time values in seconds
5. WHEN I set HTTP method THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH options
6. WHEN I add request headers THEN the system SHALL provide a key-value input interface
7. WHEN I add request body THEN the system SHALL provide a text area for JSON/form data input

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my test configurations, so that I can reuse them for repeated testing scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Save Configuration" THEN the system SHALL prompt for a configuration name
2. WHEN I provide a configuration name THEN the system SHALL save all current parameters to a JSON file
3. WHEN the configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL show a success confirmation message
4. WHEN I save a configuration with an existing name THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation to overwrite
5. IF the save operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load previously saved configurations, so that I can quickly restore test parameters without re-entering them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a list of available saved configurations
2. WHEN I select a configuration from the list THEN the system SHALL load all parameters into the form fields
3. WHEN I click "Load Configuration" THEN the system SHALL populate all input fields with the saved values
4. WHEN a configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation message
5. IF no configurations exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute pressure tests using oha, so that I can analyze the performance of my HTTP endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Start Test" THEN the system SHALL validate all required parameters are filled
2. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL construct the appropriate oha command with all parameters
3. WHEN the oha command is executed THEN the system SHALL display real-time output in a results area
4. WHEN the test completes THEN the system SHALL parse and display formatted results
5. WHEN a test is running THEN the system SHALL provide a "Stop Test" button to cancel execution
6. IF oha is not installed THEN the system SHALL display an error message with installation instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that I can use it regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL execute oha.exe commands correctly
2. WHEN the application runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL execute oha commands correctly
3. WHEN the application runs on Linux THEN the system SHALL execute oha commands correctly
4. WHEN detecting the operating system THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate oha binary path
5. WHEN file paths are used THEN the system SHALL handle OS-specific path separators correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my saved configurations, so that I can organize and maintain my test scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the configuration list THEN the system SHALL show configuration names and creation dates
2. WHEN I right-click a configuration THEN the system SHALL show options to edit, delete, or duplicate
3. WHEN I delete a configuration THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before removal
4. WHEN I edit a configuration THEN the system SHALL load it into the form and allow saving with the same name
5. WHEN configurations are stored THEN the system SHALL use a consistent JSON format across all platforms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback on test results, so that I can understand the performance metrics of my endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL display requests per second, total requests, and success rate
2. WHEN parsing oha output THEN the system SHALL extract key metrics using appropriate regular expressions
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL format numbers with appropriate precision and units
4. WHEN an error occurs during testing THEN the system SHALL display the error message clearly
5. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save results to a file
